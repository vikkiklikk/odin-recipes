  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Butter</p>
          <p>You can't make homemade Alfredo sauce without butter. The thick, velvety base adds creaminess and rich flavor. Make sure to use real butter for the most indulgent results. If you use unsalted butter, make sure to add salt to taste.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cream Cheese</p>
          <p>Not only does cream cheese add thickness and pleasant tanginess, it eliminates the need to stand over the stove making a roux.</p>
        </li>
          <p>Garlic Powder</p>
Two teaspoons of garlic powder add Italian-inspired flavor. For a stronger flavor, use fresh garlic.<p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Milk</p>
          <p>Whole milk adds creaminess, richness, and helps create the perfect smooth texture.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Parmesan cheese</p>
          <p>Parmesan thickens the sauce and adds irresistible cheesy flavor. Grate your own block instead of using shredded cheese if you can. If you don't have Parmesan, you can try substituting Gruy√®re or mozzarella.</p>
        </li>
        <li><p>Pepper</p>
          <p>Aromatic black pepper adds depth and enhances the other flavors. It's the perfect finishing touch.</p></li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Before you start making the sauce, go ahead and prep any other ingredients you'll be using in your dish (like pasta and chicken). Your sauce will be ready to toss and serve as soon as it's done cooking.</li>
      <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat, then whisk in the cream cheese and garlic powder. When the first three ingredients form a smooth sauce, start gradually whisking the milk into the mixture. It's important to add the milk a little at a time to prevent lumps and to ensure a thick texture.

        Add the cheese and pepper last. Stir the sauce until it's smooth and glossy.</li>
      <li>Toss the sauce with pasta, chicken, and/or other ingredients that are necessary for your dish. Serve immediately.</li>

    </ol>
